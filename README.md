Seasonal Sales Optimization and Competitive Pricing Strategy
A Business Data Management Capstone Project
This project focuses on providing data-driven solutions for a small B2C pharmacy, Jibon Clinic, located in rural West Bengal. By analyzing one year's worth of purchase data, this report addresses critical business challenges to foster growth, optimize inventory, and enhance profitability.

The Problem
Jibon Clinic faces two primary business challenges:

Seasonal Sales Dip: The pharmacy experiences a significant drop in sales during the winter months (November-February), leading to a lack of desired business growth.

Competitive Pricing: The owner struggles to compete with established local pharmacies, as customers perceive his prices to be higher. He needs a strategy to offer discounts without sacrificing his profit margins.

Key Solutions and Findings
This project provides actionable solutions based on a thorough analysis of the pharmacy's data.

Inventory Management to Tackle the Sales Dip
By segmenting medicines based on demand and profit, the analysis reveals that high-demand, high-profit medicines account for 60% of the total stock. However, a review of the yearly supply shows that these key medicines are often inconsistently stocked, particularly during the low-selling summer and winter months.

Recommendations:

Implement a Seasonal Inventory Calendar: Proactively stock specific medicines that are in high demand during certain seasons (e.g., cold and allergy medicines in winter, anthelmintics before monsoon).

Leverage Long Expiry Dates: The majority of top-selling medicines have a shelf life of 18-30 months, making them ideal for bulk purchase to prevent stockouts and reduce procurement costs.

Competitive Pricing for Business Growth
The analysis found that the owner primarily purchases from a single supplier, even though others offer higher discounts. By switching to more cost-effective suppliers, he can boost his annual profit by up to 15%. This increased margin can be strategically used for customer discounts.

Recommendations:

Optimize Supplier Selection: Source medicines from the supplier offering the highest discount for each medicine class, rather than relying on a single vendor.

Implement Targeted Discounts: Utilize a price elasticity analysis to offer strategic discounts without harming overall profitability. A 10% discount is recommended for moderate-demand, high-profit medicines, and a 15% discount for low-demand, high-profit segments to attract customers and move less popular stock.

Project Outcomes
This project provides a clear roadmap for Jibon Clinic to transition from intuition-based to data-driven decision-making. By implementing these recommendations, the pharmacy can effectively mitigate seasonal sales dips, strengthen its competitive position, and establish a loyal customer base for long-term growth.
